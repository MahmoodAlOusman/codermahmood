                Artificial Intelligence is a paradigm of
                computing that aims to mimic human intelligence, 
                enabling machines to learn from experience, adapt to new inputs
                , and perform tasks that traditionally require human intervention.
                At the core of AI is the ambition to create systems that can understand, 
                learn, and apply knowledge, thereby extending human capabilities and automating routine tasks. 
                The realm of AI is vast and varied, with several subfields that focus on different aspects of
                intelligence emulation.

                The applications of AI are as diverse as the fields it permeates.
                 Here’s a glimpse into the myriad ways AI is reshaping different sectors:
            </h3>
            <ol class="article-list">
                <li><b>Healthcare:</b> AI-powered diagnostic tools help in the early detection and treatment of diseases. For instance, AI algorithms can analyze medical imaging to detect anomalies such as tumors.</li>
                <li><b>Finance:</b> Fraud detection systems employ AI to monitor transactions and identify unusual activities, safeguarding individuals and institutions against financial fraud.</li>
                <li><b>Automotive:</b> Self-driving cars and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) leverage AI to interpret and respond to real-world stimuli, heralding a new era in transportation.</li>
                <li><b>Retail:</b> AI helps retailers optimize supply chains, forecast demand, and provide personalized shopping experiences through recommendation systems.</li>
                <li><b>Education:</b> Adaptive learning platforms use AI to personalize education, adjusting in real time to the needs and abilities of individual students.</li>
                <li><b>Entertainment:</b> Recommendation algorithms in platforms like Netflix or Spotify tailor suggestions based on user preferences, enhancing user engagement and satisfaction.</li>

                 Before we dive right in, however, let’s review some of the basics of artificial
                 intelligence–an essential part of understanding its evolution in recent years and impact on our daily
                 lives. As you probably know by now, artificial intelligence is the science of training machines to think and act like humans
                 ,mimicking typical behavior to perform tasks that previously, only humans could perform. 
                  It’s not all robots taking over the world, however. The benefits of artificial intelligence are quite significant: 
            </h3>
            <ol class="article-list">
                <li><b>AI doesn’t suffer from the risk of human error:</b> as long as the machine is correctly programmed, there’s no risk of the AI skipping a value, adding numbers incorrectly, or any other typical mistake that humans can easily make.</li>
                <li><b>AI can automate repetitive tasks:</b> time-consuming and repetitive tasks such as customer service, data entry, and software testing occupy lots of human resources, but AI is now able to take on these responsibilities--faster and with no risk of error.</li>
                <li><b>AI can handle large amounts of data: </b> there’s no limit to how much data artificial intelligence programs can handle, making it easy for you to collect and analyze incredibly large quantities of data. </li>
                <li><b>AI can take on tasks that are dangerous for humans:</b> through the use of robots or small machines, artificial intelligence can perform tasks that are dangerous for humans, such as coal mining or sea exploration, with less risk involved. </li>
                <li><b>AI doesn’t need to rest:</b> whether it’s an automated customer service chatbot that you use at work or a smart camera for your home security, AI tools are available 24/7, perform equally at all times, and don’t need to take breaks, eat, or sleep. </li>
